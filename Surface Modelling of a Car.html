									<h3 class="major">Project Summary:</h3>
									<p><b>Objective:</b> To demonstrate proficiency in Class-A surfacing and digital fabrication by creating a 1:10 model, dimensionally accurate, manufacturable 3D model of a classic Ferrari 308, culminating in a physical scale prototype produced via FDM 3D printing.</p>

									<p><b>Core Challenge:</b> To translate 2D reference blueprints into a complex, watertight 3D model with high aesthetic fidelity, while ensuring the design was optimized for additive manufacturing processes.</p>

									<p><b>Outcome: </b>A successful end-to-end workflow from digital sculpting to tangible prototype, resulting in a detailed, 1:10 assembled scale model that validates the surfacing techniques and print preparation strategies used.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Methodology & Technical Execution:</h3>
									<b>1. Advanced Surface Modeling in Fusion 360:</b> <br>

									<b>•&nbspBlueprint Referencing: :</b> Orthographic images (front, rear, side, top) were imported as Canvas objects on their respective planes and calibrated for scale to serve as precise tracing guides.<br>
									<b>•&nbspSurface Creation: </b>The complex curvature of the car body (hood, fenders, roofline) was constructed by creating a network of T-Spline surfaces. Control points and edges were meticulously manipulated to match the blueprints and achieve smooth, continuous curvature (G1/G2 continuity).<br>
									<b>•&nbspSolid Model Generation:</b> The quilt of fitted surfaces was stitched into a closed, watertight body and converted to a solid component for downstream use. Separate components like wheels were created using Revolve and Sweep tools.</p>

									<b>2.  Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) & Slicing: </b><br> 
                                    The finalized CAD model was prepared for 3D printing using Ultimaker Cura slicer software.


									<b>Printer & Material:</b>Prusa i3 MK3 printer with ABS filament selected for its good strength-to-weight ratio and surface finish.<br>
									<b>Viscous Damper Integration:</b>To provide the necessary energy dissipation, 6 long-stroke viscous dampers were added in a UCU (Universal-Cylindrical-Universal) joint configuration, connecting the damper mass to a fixed base (or the moving building).<br>
									<b>Print Parameters Optimized:</b><br>
										&nbsp &nbsp •&nbsp<b>Layer Height:</b> 0.05mm - 0.14mm (varied for detail vs. speed).<br>
										&nbsp &nbsp •&nbsp<b>Infill: </b> 2-10% Line pattern, providing internal structure while minimizing material use and print time.<br>
										&nbsp &nbsp •&nbsp<b>Supports: </b>Strategically generated only for severe overhangs (e.g., wheel arches) to facilitate clean printing and easy post-processing.<br>

									<b>3.  Physical Prototyping & Assembly:</b> <br>
                                    
									•&nbspThe components were 3D printed, post-processed (support removal, light sanding), and assembled.<br>
									•&nbspFasteners: M20 hex Allen bolts were used to attach the wheels to the axle hubs, mimicking the real-life assembly interface.<br>
								
									<b>Key Skills Demonstrated:</b>
									<p><b>1.&nbspAdvanced CAD & Surfacing: </b> Mastery of Fusion 360's Form/Patch workspace for creating complex, organic geometry from 2D references.<br>
									<b>2.&nbspBlueprint Interpretation: </b>Ability to interpret orthographic views and translate them into accurate 3D models.<br>
									<b>3.&nbspDesign for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM): </b>Practical application of slicing parameter optimization for FDM printing.<br>
									<b>4.&nbsp3D Printing Operation: </b> Hands-on experience with FDM printer operation and post-processing.</p>
